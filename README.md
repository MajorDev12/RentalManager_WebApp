# 🏠 Rental / Property Management System - Frontend

This is the **frontend application** for the Rental / Property Management System, built with **React** and styled with **CSS**.  
It provides a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface for managing rental properties, tenants, maintenance, and payments.
